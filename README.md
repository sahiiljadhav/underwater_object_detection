# **Object Detection System with Distance Measurement**  
**Created by Sahil Jadhav**  

---

## **Project Overview**  
This project implements a real-time object detection system with distance measurement capabilities using a standard webcam. The system can detect objects within a defined restricted area and estimate their distance from the camera. It's built using Python and leverages deep learning for accurate object detection.
