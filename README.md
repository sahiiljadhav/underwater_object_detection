Object Detection System with Distance Measurement

Created by Sahil Jadhav

Project Overview

This project implements a real-time object detection system with distance measurement capabilities using a standard webcam. The system detects objects within a defined restricted area and estimates their distance from the camera. It is built using Python and leverages deep learning for accurate object detection.

Features

Real-time object detection using webcam

Distance measurement for detected objects

Configurable restricted area monitoring

Camera calibration system

Visual feedback with bounding boxes and distance information

Detection confidence scoring

Prerequisites

Python 3.7 or higher

Webcam (built-in or external)
